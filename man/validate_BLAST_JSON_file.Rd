\description{
Checks to see if the provided BLAST output file is 1) in .json format, and
2) follows the conventions of results from NCBI's BLAST search tool. See the
example BLAST output files in the inst/extdata directory for more
information. In general, each BLAST output file must have the following
attribute structure:
\itemize{
 \item An overarching attribute 'BlastOutput2'. The value of 'BlastOutput2'
 is a list of 'reports', each containing results for a query.
 \item Within a 'report', the query title and length can be accessed by
 traversing the attributes: 'report' -> 'results' -> 'search'.
 Their respective attribute names are 'query_title' and 'query_len'
 \item The 'hits' attribute can also be accessed this way, and contains
 a list of hits each representing a collection of HSPs for a single subject
 sequence.
}
