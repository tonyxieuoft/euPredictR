# euPredictR

An R package for predicting protein-coding gene sequences in novel
eukaryotic organisms based on sequence homology, using raw output
generated by the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) algorithm.

## Description

`euPredictR` is a tool that streamlines and add new functionality to
workflows that use the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST)
algorithm for sequence homology-based gene prediction in eukaryotic
organisms. In particular, `euPredictR` focuses on the downstream process
of parsing and analyzing raw BLAST output to construct protein-coding
sequence predictions for novel species, rather than running the
algorithm itself. After constructing gene predictions, the tool allows
users to assess the quality of the genes it predicts by providing gene
completeness estimates as visual output. There currently lacks a unified
interface or package for users to conduct downstream analyses of BLAST
results in eukaryotic gene prediction contexts, nor any that help
directly visualize the results; this is the gap that `euPredictR` fills.
The package was developed using `R version 4.4.1 (2024-06-14)`,
`Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64` and
`Running under: Windows 10 x64 (build 19045)`.

## Installation

You can install the development version of euPredictR from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("tonyxieuoft/euPredictR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(euPredictR)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
summary(cars)
#>      speed           dist       
#>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
#>  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
#>  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
#>  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
#>  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
#>  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

<img src="man/figures/README-pressure-1.png" width="100%" />

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
