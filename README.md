# euPredictR

An R package for predicting protein-coding gene sequences in novel
eukaryotic organisms based on sequence homology, using raw output
generated by the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) algorithm.

## Description

A paragraph that describes the purpose of your R package and biological
data being analyzed. Explain how your package add to or improve a
current work flow in bioinformatics or computational biology (i.e., how
is it unique?, what issue does it address?). Finally, include the R
version (not RStudio version) and platform (Mac, Windows, Linux (Debian,
Fedora/Redhat, Ubuntu)), used to develop the package. You may obtain
this information by running `utils::sessionInfo()`. There should be no
`Shiny` implementation at this point. E.g., <br> <br> <br>
`TestingPackage` is an R package to demonstrate components of a simple R
package with RNA sequencing data. The R package includes the main
components: DESCRIPTION, NAMESPACE, man subdirectory and R subdirectory.
Additionally, LICENSE, README and subdirectories vignettes, tests, data
and inst are also explored. The package is targeted for BCB410H (Applied
Bioinformatics) students, who are to define a useful tool for the
analysis of biological data in the format of a public R package housed
on GitHub. The scope of the R package is to add to or improve a current
work flow in bioinformatics or computational biology. The tool should
contain functions to perform analysis of biological data and to produce
a compelling graphical output, ideally to support for exploratory
analysis. The `TestingPackage` package was developed using
`R version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23)`,
`Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin17.0 (64-bit)` and
`Running under: macOS Ventura 13.2`.

## Installation

You can install the development version of euPredictR from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("tonyxieuoft/euPredictR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(euPredictR)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
summary(cars)
#>      speed           dist       
#>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
#>  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
#>  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
#>  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
#>  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
#>  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

<img src="man/figures/README-pressure-1.png" width="100%" />

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
