# euPredictR

An R package for predicting protein-coding gene sequences in novel eukaryotic organisms based on sequence homology, using raw output generated by the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) algorithm.

## Description

A paragraph that describes the purpose of your R package and biological data being analyzed. Explain how your package add to or improve a current work flow in bioinformatics or computational biology (i.e., how is it unique?, what issue does it address?). Finally, include the R version (not RStudio version) and platform (Mac, Windows, Linux (Debian, Fedora/Redhat, Ubuntu)), used to develop the package. You may obtain this information by running ``` utils::sessionInfo()```. There should be no `Shiny` implementation at this point. E.g.,

`TestingPackage` is an R package to demonstrate components of a simple R package with RNA sequencing data. The R package includes the main components: DESCRIPTION, NAMESPACE, man subdirectory and R subdirectory. Additionally, LICENSE, README and subdirectories vignettes, tests, data and inst are also explored. The package is targeted for BCB410H (Applied Bioinformatics) students, who are to define a useful tool for the analysis of biological data in the format of a public R package housed on GitHub. The scope of the R package is to add to or improve a current work flow in bioinformatics or computational biology. The tool should contain functions to perform analysis of biological data and to produce a compelling graphical output, ideally to support for exploratory analysis. The `TestingPackage` package was developed using `R version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23)`, `Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin17.0 (64-bit)` and `Running under: macOS Ventura 13.2`.

## Installation

You can install the development version of euPredictR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("tonyxieuoft/euPredictR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(euPredictR)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
