# euPredictR

An R package for predicting protein-coding gene sequences in novel eukaryotic organisms based on sequence homology, using raw output generated by the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) algorithm.

## Description

`euPredictR` is a tool that streamlines and add new functionality to workflows 
that use the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) algorithm for sequence 
homology-based gene prediction in eukaryotic organisms. In particular, 
`euPredictR` focuses on the downstream process of parsing and analyzing raw 
BLAST output to construct protein-coding sequence predictions for novel species,
rather than running the algorithm itself. After constructing gene predictions, 
the tool allows users to assess the quality of the genes it predicts by 
providing gene completeness estimates as visual output. There currently lacks a
unified interface or package for users to conduct downstream analyses of BLAST 
results in eukaryotic gene prediction contexts, nor any that help directly 
visualize the results; this is the gap that `euPredictR` fills. The package was 
developed using `R version 4.4.1 (2024-06-14)`, 
`Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64` and `Running under: Windows 10 x64 (build 19045)`.

## Installation

You can install the development version of euPredictR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("tonyxieuoft/euPredictR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(euPredictR)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
